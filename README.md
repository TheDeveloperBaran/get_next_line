This is my "get_next_line" project for Ecol√© 42. get_next_line aims reading line by line from a "file descriptor". File descriptor is a pointer to a file to 
accessing this file and manipulating or reading it.

Topics covered in get_next_line:

-Static variables
-read() function
-BUFFER type and BUFFER_SIZE
-free() and malloc() functions.
-file descriptors alias fd
